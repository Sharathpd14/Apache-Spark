# Apache Spark Architecture

## Spark Architecture and Components

Apache Spark's architecture is like a well-coordinated team, where each component plays a crucial role. These components work together seamlessly, ensuring efficient, distributed data processing while handling large-scale computations with speed and reliability.

### **1. Driver Program**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **driver program** is the entry point of a Spark application. It plays a crucial role in managing the execution of Spark jobs.

#### âœ¨ **Responsibilities**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Converting transformations into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):**  
  The driver translates user-defined operations into a DAG, which represents the execution flow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Allocating tasks to executors:**  
  It schedules and distributes tasks across worker nodes to execute computations efficiently.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Monitoring job execution:**  
  The driver tracks the progress of tasks, handles failures, and retries tasks if necessary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Collecting results:**  
  Once computations are complete, the driver gathers the processed data from executors.


&nbsp;

### **2. Cluster Manager**  

Spark can run on different **cluster managers** to distribute and manage resources across nodes. These include:  

- **Standalone Mode** â€“ Default cluster manager provided by Spark.  
- **Apache Mesos** â€“ A general-purpose cluster manager.  
- **Hadoop YARN** â€“ Widely used in Hadoop ecosystems.  
- **Kubernetes** â€“ A container-based cluster manager for Spark applications.  

The **Cluster Manager** allocates resources (executors) to the **Driver Program**, ensuring smooth execution.

&nbsp;

### **3. Executors**  

Executors are the **worker nodes** in a Spark cluster responsible for executing assigned tasks.  

#### âœ¨ **Key Responsibilities**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Run tasks** and return results to the driver.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Store intermediate data** in memory or disk for fault tolerance.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ… **Communicate with the driver** and shuffle data between nodes for distributed processing.  

Executors **run in parallel** across multiple nodes, making Spark a powerful distributed system.

&nbsp;

### **4. Tasks**  

Tasks are the **smallest units of execution** in Spark, representing operations applied to partitions of data.  

ðŸ“Œ **How Tasks Work?**  
- A Spark **job** is divided into **stages** based on transformations.  
- Each **stage** consists of multiple **tasks**.
-  Each task process 1 **partition**.  
- Tasks run **independently and in parallel** across executors.  

Efficient task execution ensures high performance and scalability. ðŸš€

### **5. DAG Scheduler**  

The **DAG Scheduler** translates user-defined computations into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** and optimizes execution.

ðŸ“Œ **How DAG Works**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1. High-Level Transformations**  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”¸  Spark operations like `map()`, `filter()`, and `groupBy()` create a **DAG of RDDs**.  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”¸  These transformations are **lazy**, meaning execution starts only when an action (e.g., `collect()`, `count()`) is triggered.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2. Series of Stages**  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”¸  The DAG is **divided into stages** based on **shuffle dependencies**.  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”¸  Each stage represents a sequence of transformations that **do not require data shuffling**.  

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**3. Parallel Task Execution**  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”¸  Each **stage consists of multiple tasks** that operate on data partitions.  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”¸  Tasks within a stage run **in parallel** across executors.  
  
 

A well-structured DAG ensures that Spark optimally executes tasks while minimizing recomputation.

## âš¡ Apache Spark Execution Process  

Apache Spark follows a **distributed execution model**, where tasks are divided across multiple nodes for parallel processing. Hereâ€™s how the execution process works:  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Application Submission**  
- User submits a Spark job using `spark-submit`.  
- The **Driver Program** is launched and initializes the execution.  

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **DAG Creation & Logical Execution Plan**  
- Spark converts transformations (`map`, `filter`, etc.) into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.  
- The DAG is **optimized** and split into multiple **stages** based on dependencies.  

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Resource Allocation**  
- The **Driver** communicates with the **Cluster Manager** (Standalone, YARN, Mesos, or Kubernetes).  
- The **Cluster Manager** allocates **Executors**, which are worker nodes for processing tasks.  

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Task Scheduling & Parallel Execution**  
- The **DAG Scheduler** assigns stages and tasks to available executors.  
- Each **stage** consists of multiple **tasks** that process data partitions **in parallel**.  

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Data Processing & Execution**  
- **Executors** execute assigned tasks and process data.  
- Intermediate results may be stored in **memory (RDD caching)** or **disk (if memory is insufficient)**.  

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Shuffling & Data Exchange**  
- If tasks require data from different partitions (e.g., `groupBy`, `reduceByKey`), **shuffle operations** occur.  
- Data is **reorganized across nodes**, which can impact performance.  

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Task Completion & Result Collection**  
- Once all tasks are completed, **executors return results to the driver**.  
- The **driver collects the final output** and either **returns it to the user or writes it to storage** (HDFS, S3, etc.).  

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Application Termination**  
- After execution, the **driver shuts down** executors and releases resources.  
- The Spark application **terminates**, completing the process.
